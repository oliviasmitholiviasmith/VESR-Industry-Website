<h3>My Role in the Company</h3>
<p>My role in our advertising agency is to create and design the campaigns and advertisements. Based on our client's needs and their brand identity, I tailor to the visual elements in an engaging way. Making campaigns and advertisements easy to understand and persuade help them to be the most effective. I use tools such as Canva, Adobe Creative Cloud, and Buffer to create these visuals. Lastly, I collaborate with my coworkers to ensure a smooth and well organized workflow.
<h3>Potiental Ethical Issues </h3>
<p>A potiental ethical issue I could face in my position could be presenting false or exaggerated claims that misleads customers into purchasing a product or service. Another example of an ethical issue is implementing manipulative emotional appeals to viewers that intimidate them into buying something because they think it is needed. Lastly, another ethical issue with this work can be using client's or customer's personal data without permission to create statistics and more. 
<h3>What are some cybersecurity issues that could arise?</h3>
<p>The first cybersecurity issue that could arise in this industry is the possibility of client and customer data getting leaked or compromised by hackers. A second cybersecurity issue in the advertising industry are hackers gaining access to our database where we create advertisements. These hackers could manipulate the content and information and spread them across social media, giving the company or brand a negative or false reputation.
<h3>Cybersecurity Practices Used in this Industry</h3>
    <p>Implementing practices such as staff training, secure technology, and multi-step authentication can help keep your business safe. Training your staff to be able to interpret if emails, phone calls, or texts are legitimate or if they are a phishing. Having secure and reliable technology such as a firewall and anti-malware software can insure that no unauthorized users will have access to your data. Lastly, multi-factor authentication can create barriers to again prevent unauthorized people accessing your data and information.<q></q> </p>
