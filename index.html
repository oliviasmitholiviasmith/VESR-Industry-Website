<h2>Personal Values</h2>
<div>
<h3>Respect</h3>
<p>Respect is important to me because I believe everyone deserves to be treated the same despite their differences. If you treat people the way you want to be treated, they will most likely reciprocate. This ultimately makes interacting with people more enjoyable leads them to want to be around you more. I developed this value at a young age and was always taught to treat everyone with respect. Individuals will remember how you treated them and that reflects how people view you and your reputation. If you don't treat people with respect your relationships might suffer and you may find yourself not respected by others.

<h3>Perseverance</h3>
<p>Perseverance is important to me because no matter what happens, the world keeps spinning aand life doesn't stop. If you keep trying your best you will eventually get to where you want to be in various aspects of life. I developed this value because I have come across many obstacles in my life. If I were to have given up from being discouraged or not getting my way I wouldn't be where I am today. If you don't perservere through the hard times you will never know how much you could have grown and learned from the situation. 
<h3>Reliability</h3>
<p>Reliability is important to me because it is the foundation of trust. If someone is not reliable, friends and family will remember that when making a decision of who to confide in. Reliability can mean showing up to something planned or even just being there for someone when they need advice or a friend. I developed this value because I know how good it feels to be able to count on someone to be there for you. By doing this in return, your friendships and relationships will be much stronger and beneficial. If you aren't reliable, it makes it hard for people to trust that you will show up for them emotionally and physically. 
<h3>Gratitude</h3>
<p>Gratitude is important to me because I believe I am very blessed for the life I was given. Practicing gratitude can make you a more appreciative person and overall make you more aware of all you have been given. Being able to express this to other people and apply it to your life can actually improve your mental and physical health. I have developed this value from being aware of how many opportunities I have been given and all of the people I have supporting me throughout my lfe journey. If you don't practice gratitude you might get caught up in the things you don't have that others might, instead of being appreciative of all the things you do have.
